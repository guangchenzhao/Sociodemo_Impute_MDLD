# Sociodemo_Impute_MDLD
Imputing socio-demographics from mobile device location data (MDLD)
Passively collected MDLD is anonymized and lacks socio-demographic information, such as age, income, gender, etc. 
Here a decision tree is used to impute such information. The training dataset is based on the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) integrated with the American Community Survey (ACS).
